Hello and welcome to my... *blog*?

This is a space where I post things I find interesting. You’ll find a mix of tutorials, TryHackMe room write-ups, and notes on things I learn at university. The main purpose of this site is to help me improve my writing, reinforce what I’ve learned, and maybe share something useful along the way.

My background is in cloud operations, but I’m also interested in OSINT (and most things that end with *INT*), penetration testing, math, and coding—mainly Python. Outside of work, I like to explore what I call “real-life side quests,” and this blog is one of them.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or a new side quest I should check out, feel free to get in touch—my contact details are on the page. Always open to learning or working on something different.
